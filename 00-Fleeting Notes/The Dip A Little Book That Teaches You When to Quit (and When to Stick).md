Starting off with a bad advice from Vince Lombardi: "Quitters never win and Winners never quit"

-  The book suggests *Winners quit all the time. They just quit the right stuff at the right time*

It's true that people celebrate superstars and high time go behind what's number one. I got to know some interesting facts

> **Fact 1**: Top ten flavors of ice cream according to **International Ice Cream Association**:

Vanilla, Chocolate, Butter Pecan, Strawberry, Neapolitan, Chocolate Chip, French Vanilla, Cookies 'n' Cream, Fudge Ripple and Praline

I felt the distribution would be left skewed for the top-ranked flavors but to my surprise Vanilla seemed to be an anomaly.

- Reflecting upon this, its true that people always seek what's best and don't want risk. Be it job hiring, doctors consultancy, shopping .etc.
- Also, best is subjective and one might be best for its price, features, durability .etc and with numerous specializations happening across the world a lot of micro-markets have opened. 

> The book dwells into a world of infinity where people have uncountable choices and might choose what is the best blindly. It is crucial to put in the effort to get best at what we do.
